# React Markdown Previewer

[[Demo]](https://codepen.io/d-o-t/full/RwgJyOP)

This project was a little bit tricky, mainly due to my design choices. Display-width and height can always be a bit problematic and will often have problems with overflow and overlap. Gladly, I managed to fix all of those problems. :)

The markdown was made possible with the [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) npm package.

The input (left) will automatically display the markdown on the right side of the screen. A pre-written text describing markdown's capabilities is automatically loaded upon opening the site.
