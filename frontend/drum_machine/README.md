# Minimalistic Purple Drum Machine

[[Demo]](https://codepen.io/d-o-t/full/jOwebed)

This React project uses key press and click listeners to get the input. Each input (key/letter) has a corresponding drum sound from freesound.org, retrieving from an array.  
You can find the sound authors credited in the source.
