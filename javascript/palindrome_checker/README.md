# Palindrome Checker

I made an environment for my palindrome checker script in React. Please check out the [[Demo]](https://codepen.io/d-o-t/full/Vwzdzee)! :-)

This app will determine whether the text you input is a palindrome.  
It will only check for alphabetical letters [a-z] and arabic numbers [0-9], but it will reverse anything.
