# File Metadata Microservice

[[DEMO]](https://file-metadata-microservice.d-0-t.repl.co/)

This project was made for freeCodeCamp's Back End course.

It is a simple API which uses the multer package to get information about the file you want to upload.

Your file will not upload anywhere, the data is just stored in memory.
