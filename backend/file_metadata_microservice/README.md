# File Metadata Microservice

- [[DEMO]](https://replit.com/@d-0-t/File-Metadata-Microservice)

This project was made for freeCodeCamp's Back End course.

It is a simple API which uses the multer package to get information about the file you want to upload.

Your file will not upload anywhere, the data is just stored in memory.
