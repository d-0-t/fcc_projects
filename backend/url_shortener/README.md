# URL Shortener

[[DEMO]](https://replit.com/@d-0-t/URL-Shortener)
[[GitHub]](https://github.com/d-0-t/fcc_projects/edit/main/backend/url_shortener)

The title is a bit misleading because in the Replit host this definitely won't be a shortener in all cases.

To use it, input a link in the URL field, then click the button. A JSON object will be returned to your screen, and you can use the new generated short_url number and append it to siteurl/api/shorturl/.

If the url already exists in the database, it will return the JSON it did after creation, and will not redirect you upon this action.
